# 3D Boids algorithm - be super cool if applicable on satellites

# Start with orbital motion

# Implement collision avoidance - like geese agents


# Orbital motion goals:
    # Start scenario similar to rocket release
    # Achieve even spacing - phasing
    # Correct orbit
    # Collision avoidance
        # Follow boids algorithms
        # Sense other boids in close proximity
        # Can define a view angle in here if we want - but unlimited orientation in space
        # Steer away from other boids in close proximity

    # Avoid a rocket
    # Track total delta-v if possible
    # Plot in vpython
